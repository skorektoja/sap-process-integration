#summary Simle Explanation Http Post Tool.

= Introduction =

The Http Post Tool is made to send repeatable test cases to mutliple environments of a SAP Process Integration/ABAP Proxy Runtime landscape for testing purposes.

It supports posting plain XML and SOAP Messages to the Integration Engine (Central/Proxy Runtime) and to the SAP PI 7.3 HTTP Java based Adapter.

The tool dates back to 2005 from my first workshops for SAP XI 3.0, so it's javascript impl might not be on latest level. I could imagine a way more fly version with local storage and jQuery. However it works fine on common IE and Firerfox Versions.

= Test Data =

Test Data could be entered either manually or stored locally.

 * Storage of environment data (server, host and interfaces to test) are stored in a JSON String (Data.js)
 * Storage of Payload is done locally in a folder named payloads
